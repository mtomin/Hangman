# Hangman

A rudimentary hangman game. The user interface is built with WPF while hangman words are stored in a text file. The currently available words are taken from [IMDB Top 250 movies list](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top). 


### User interface

User interface shows the current state of the hangman word, a textbox to enter a letter and the already tried letters. Upon making a mistake, an appropriate image is shown.

When the movie has been guessed, the user is congratulated and shown the total number of guesses/number of misses. Alternately, the user is informed he lost due to reaching the maximum amount of errors.
